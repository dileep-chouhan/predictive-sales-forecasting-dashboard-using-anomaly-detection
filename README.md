# Predictive Sales Forecasting Dashboard using Anomaly Detection

**Overview:**

This project develops a sales performance dashboard that visualizes key sales metrics and incorporates anomaly detection to proactively identify and predict unusual sales patterns.  The dashboard provides insights into current sales trends and helps anticipate potential issues or opportunities, enabling data-driven decision-making for improved sales performance.  The analysis leverages time series analysis techniques to detect anomalies and forecast future sales.


**Technologies Used:**

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* scikit-learn (or specify the specific anomaly detection algorithm used, e.g., IsolationForest)
* [Add other libraries as needed]


**How to Run:**

1. **Clone the repository:**  `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the dashboard:** Execute the main script using `python main.py`


**Example Output:**

The script will generate the following outputs:

* **Console Output:**  Printed summaries of key sales metrics, anomaly detection results (e.g., identified anomalous data points), and potentially forecasted sales figures.
* **Visualizations:**  The dashboard will generate several visualizations, including:
    * A line plot showing the overall sales trend over time (`sales_trend.png` or similar).
    * A plot highlighting detected sales anomalies (`anomaly_detection.png` or similar).
    * [Add other visualizations generated]

These visualizations will be saved as image files in the project directory.  The specific file names might vary slightly depending on the implementation.


**Data:**

[Optional: Briefly describe the data used, its source, and any preprocessing steps.  For example: "The project utilizes a CSV file containing daily sales data for the past year.  The data was preprocessed to handle missing values and outliers."]


**Contributing:**

[Optional: Add a section on how others can contribute to the project.]
